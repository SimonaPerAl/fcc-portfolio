			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Simona. I'm an amateur web developer. I've recently started learning HTML and CSS. It's been lots of fun and I'm happy with my progress even if I know there's still a long way for me to go. My next challenge will be learning Javascript while deepening my knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>

			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<p>Here are the projects I made for the Free Code Camp. I had to fullfill the user stories to pass the tests. At the same time I tried to make it interesting by giving the pages my own flair and telling a story.</p>
			<div id="project-container">
			<div class="summary" data-text="Tribute Page: I thought a visual artist would be a good choice, since I could showcast their work in the page. I choose Artemisia Gentileschi. Researching her was very interesting. The page design is very simple, I tried to make it clear and choose colors and typographies I thought would suit the subject.">

			<div class="summary" data-text="Survey Form: I believe in libraries as a place of community. So I imagined what the librarians of a small-to-medium public library would like to know about their patrons. There are some general deomographic questions, and some library-specific ones.">

			<div class="summary" data-text="Product Landing Page: A fun, silly page. I drew inspiration from several sources, the main one being obviously Studio Ghibli's 'Kiki's Delivery Service'. I gave it a dark yet colorful theme because I  wanted it to feel mysterius but not menacing, the desing in general is intentionally childish and retro.">

			<div class="summary" data-text="Technical documentation Page: I decided to use this project as an oportunity deepen my knowledge of coding. I choose CSS animations because it's a subject the FCC course touches briefly, so I knew a bit about it, but there was still room for me to learn. Since there are so many animations playing at the same time, I wanted the desing ti look clean and simple.">
